This ‘kid’ had just suffered a crushing loss in the 12th (of 14) games of the World Chess Championship. With scores now tied and two games to play, his attitude towards the loss—and the upcoming games, arguably the most significant in chess history—convinced me to take that flight.

On the plane, I played a movie over and over in my head. I saw myself meeting this 18-year-old in-person for the first time, wrapping my arms around him – both of us probably in tears – and then looking him in the eye to say; “You’re the World Champion. And you deserve it.”

Two days later, Gukesh D was crowned the Youngest Chess World Champion in History, surpassing Garry Kasparov, who held the record at 22. The victory was as unexpected as it was dramatic. The final game 14, seemed destined for a tame draw – even the all-knowing chess computer gave a 98% probability of this outcome.

Most people were heading home and would return the next day for a sudden death rapid-chess decider (a much faster version). That scenario would’ve favored Ding Liren, the reigning champion and a superior rapid-chess player.

Gukesh was remarkably fresh and poised, while Ding seemed to be showing signs of tiring. Instead of conceding the draw, and like he’d done in previous games where he’d kept his opponent at the chessboard for sometimes 90 minutes longer than expected, Gukesh was again pushing despite an inevitable draw.

His strategy wasn’t about winning the game outright; but about mentally and physically tiring his opponent before the following days sudden death tiebreaker.

Then, in an almost cruel twist, Ding made a basic error that would heart-breakingly cost him his title and seal Gukesh’s place in history as the youngest-ever World Champion.

For six months leading up to this match, I spent over 40 hours on weekly 90-minute video calls with Gukesh, preparing him for this moment. One world title later, here are six practical lessons from an 18-year-old that we can all apply to sport, business, and life.
